### Build, test, run (Julia)
- Run specific tests with `julia --project=. /test/<pathToTestFile.jl>`
- Always test the added functions in an own testcase file or a combine multiple functions that depend on each other

### Context gathering
Goal: Get enough context fast. Parallelize discovery and stop as soon as you can act.

Method:
- Start broad, then fan out to focused subqueries.
- In parallel, launch varied queries; read top hits per query. Deduplicate paths and cache; don’t repeat queries.
- Avoid over searching for context. If needed, run targeted searches in one parallel batch.

Early stop criteria:
- You can name exact content to change.
- Top hits converge (~70%) on one area/path.

Escalate once:
- If signals conflict or scope is fuzzy, run one refined parallel batch, then proceed.

Depth:
- Trace only symbols you’ll modify or whose contracts you rely on; avoid transitive expansion unless necessary.

Loop:
- Batch search → minimal plan → complete task.
- Search again only if validation fails or new unknowns appear. Prefer acting over more searching.

### persistence
- You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
- Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
- Never stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.
- Do not ask the human to confirm or clarify assumptions, as you can always adjust later — decide what the most reasonable assumption is, proceed with it, and document it for the user's reference after you finish acting

### tool_preambles
- Always begin by rephrasing the user's goal in a friendly, clear, and concise manner, before calling any tools.
- Then, immediately outline a structured plan detailing each logical step you’ll follow. - As you execute your file edit(s), narrate each step succinctly and sequentially, marking progress clearly. 
- Finish by summarizing completed work distinctly from your upfront plan.

### coding
- Use clear and descriptive names for functions and variables.
- Write modular code by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions.
- Include comments and documentation to explain the purpose and usage of code.
- Follow consistent coding conventions and style guidelines.
- Optimize code for performance and efficiency but prioritize simplicity and readability.
